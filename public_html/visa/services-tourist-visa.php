            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">A tourist visa grants legal entry for leisure, tourism, or visiting
                    friends and family, allowing for pre-determined stays and providing flexibility for multiple entries
                    or longer validity periods. It enables travel to a wide range of countries and can be a key
                    component for international education, medical tourism, or professional travel that requires repeat
                    visits. Holding certain long-term tourist visas, like a 10-year US visa, can also simplify travel to
                    other countries that offer visa waivers or "visa on arrival" to holders of those passports. </p>

                <h3>Core benefits</h3>
                <p>Legal entry for leisure: A tourist visa legally allows you to enter a foreign country for
                    recreational purposes, such as sightseeing, vacationing, or visiting family and friends.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <p>Flexibility and convenience: It can offer flexible duration, sometimes allowing multiple entries over
                    a specific period, which avoids the need for frequent new visa applications for repeat trips.
                    Extended validity: Some visas, like the 10-year US B-1/B-2 visa, provide a long period of validity,
                    making future travel much simpler.
                </p>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <p>Access to multiple countries: A single multiple-entry visa can provide access to a group of
                    countries, like the Schengen Area in Europe, eliminating the need for separate visas for each
                    nation. </p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <p>Simplified travel to other destinations: A valid tourist visa from a trusted country can make it
                    easier to get visas for, or even enter visa-free, other nations, enhancing travel credibility and
                    convenience. </p>
