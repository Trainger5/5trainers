            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">A student visa provides benefits such as access to world-class
                    education, opportunities for work and career advancement through options like Optional Practical
                    Training (OPT) and internships, and potential pathways to permanent residency. Other advantages
                    include cultural immersion, networking opportunities, flexibility to switch programs or schools, and
                    the chance to develop language skills. For certain visas, like the Schengen visa, it can also allow
                    for travel between member countries. </p>

            </div>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <h3>Educational and career benefits</h3>
                <p>Access to education: Gain entry into universities and programs that may not be available in your home
                    country, with many institutions offering high-quality education, research facilities, and
                    specialized programs.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <p>Work opportunities: Legally work part-time on-campus and, depending on the visa, potentially
                    off-campus or in specific internships during your studies to help cover expenses. </p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <p>Optional Practical Training (OPT): Many student visas, like the F-1 in the U.S., allow for up to 12
                    months of work after graduation in a field related to your degree, which significantly boosts your
                    resume. </p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <p>Career advancement: Gain valuable international work experience, build a global network, and enhance
                    your long-term career prospects. </p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <p>Flexibility: In some cases, a student visa may allow you to transfer between schools or change your
                    academic program without starting the visa process over. </p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <h4>Cultural and personal benefits</h4>

                    perspective and cultural sensitivity. </p>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">

            </div>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <p>Travel: Some visas, like the Schengen visa, allow you to travel freely between multiple countries
                    without needing a separate visa for each, as long as you stay within the common travel area's
                    limits. </p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <h4>Potential long-term benefits</h4>
                <p>Immigration pathways: In some countries, a student visa can serve as a stepping stone to more
                    permanent residency or citizenship after graduation, provided you meet the necessary requirements.
                </p>
