                Belgium is a preferred destination for many international students because of its education quality,
                lifestyle and work opportunities. At 5Trainers Visa Consultancy, we help you understand entry requirements,
                language scores, tuition costs and available scholarship options where applicable.
            </p>
            <p class="content-paragraph">
                We also provide guidance on the visa process, documentation, timelines and post-study work or residency routes,
                based on the latest available information from official sources. Visit our office or contact us to discuss how
                Belgium fits into your study or immigration plans.
