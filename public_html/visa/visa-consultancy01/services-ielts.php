        <ul class="content-list" data-animate>
            <!-- <li>Structured modules for Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking.</li> -->
             <li>It might be obvious to you that the Academic IELTS is intended for (prospective) university students applying for admission in universities and programs in which English is the medium of instruction. But that’s not all – many professionals and job applicants may find that they are also required to provide scores for this version of the test.</li>
            <!-- <li>Regular full-length mock tests under exam-like conditions.</li> -->
             <li>One example is medical work. If you want to be a medical professional in Ireland, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, or Canada, you’ll definitely need to sit the Academic IELTS. A wide range of medical jobs require this version of the exam, including doctor, nurse, pharmacist, and even hospital lab technician.</li>
            <!-- <li>Individual speaking interviews and feedback on pronunciation and fluency.</li> -->
             <li>Unlike the general training version, the academic version allows test takers to demonstrate some reading and writing skills that aren’t necessarily part of the everyday communicative experience of English speakers. These are considered to be distinct from reading and writing skills for general purposes (see the section on content below).</li>
            <li>Strategies for time management and tackling tricky question types.</li>
        </ul>
