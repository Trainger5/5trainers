            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <h3>1. High-Quality Education</h3>
                <p>Canada’s universities are globally recognised for academic excellence, research innovation, and
                    practical learning. Institutions like the University of Toronto, McGill University, and the
                    University of British Columbia consistently rank in the QS World University Rankings 2026, with all
                    three appearing in the global top 50. Canadian degrees are respected worldwide, and the country’s
                    Designated Learning Institutions (DLIs) ensure quality standards across programmes.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <h3>2. Multicultural and Inclusive Society</h3>
                <p>Canada was the first country to adopt multiculturalism as official policy, and today it remains one
                    of the most diverse nations globally. Over 22% of Canadians are foreign-born, and cities like
                    Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal host vibrant international communities. International students will
                    find cultural familiarity, support networks, and opportunities to celebrate their heritage while
                    engaging with others from around the world.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <h3>3. Affordable Education</h3>
                <p>Compared to the US, UK, or Australia, Canada offers relatively lower tuition fees and living costs.
                    Tuition: CAD 15,000–40,000/year depending on programme and institution
                    Living expenses: CAD 10,000–15,000/year
                    This affordability, combined with high academic standards, makes Canada a smart choice for students
                    seeking value and quality.

                    Express Entry.</p>
