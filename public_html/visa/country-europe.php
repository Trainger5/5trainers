            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <h3>1. Flexible Post-Study Work Opportunities</h3>
                <p>One of Europe’s biggest advantages is its favorable post-study work regulations, which provide
                    students ample time to secure employment after completing their studies.
                    France: Offers up to 2 years of post-study work rights and an additional alumni visa valid for up to
                    5 years for graduates of French universities.
                    Denmark: Allows up to 3 years of post-study work options.
                    These policies make Europe an attractive choice compared to countries like the UK, US, or Canada,
                    where post-study work periods may be more restrictive.
                </p>
            </div>

                    Living expenses are generally lower compared to destinations like the US or UK, especially in
                    smaller cities and towns.
                    Additionally, many universities offer scholarships, financial aid, and even tuition-free education
                    in some countries like Germany and Norway, making Europe highly accessible to international
                    students.
