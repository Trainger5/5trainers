            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">IELTS is important because it's a globally recognized English language
                    test that opens doors for studying, working, and migrating abroad. It's accepted by thousands of
                    institutions, including universities in the UK, Australia, the US, and Canada, as well as by
                    immigration authorities in countries like the UK, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. A strong score
                    can demonstrate your English proficiency to employers and help you secure a visa or a place in an
                    academic program.</p>
