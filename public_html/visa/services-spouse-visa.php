            <div style="margin-bottom: 16px;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 16px;">A spouse visa allows a person to live with their spouse in a foreign
                    country, with benefits that typically include the ability to work and study, travel, and eventually
                    apply for permanent residency. Other benefits can include immediate work authorization upon arrival
                    in some cases, access to public services like healthcare, and the option to apply for benefits if
                    the spouse has a disability. The exact benefits vary by country, so it's important to check the
                    specific regulations for the destination country. </p>
